# Keyword
Extracting keywords from articles, while searching for the most relevant article. This technique is heavily used in search engines.

One way to summarize the contents of an article is by describing it in terms of its keywords. I have developed a program that will automatically extract keywords from an article, using techniques from information retrieval and computational linguistics. The logic goes as follow: identify potential keywords is to simply take words that appear frequently in the article so we can rank words according to how frequent they are (this is called the term frequency), and select the top ranking words as the keywords. To adjust for bad keywords (like, as, the, a, etc.), we will incorporate a second factor called the inverse document frequency into our ranking. We will penalize words according to how many documents they appear in, so, words that appear in all or nearly all the documents, such as \the", would be heavily penalized, and would rank lower than words that are specific to a particular article, such as \cat".
